READFILE: Regression Codfes Project

This folder contains several Jupyter notebooks and small CSV files that demonstrate
different approaches to linear and polynomial regression, both using closed-form
solutions and iterative methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Contents:
- polynomial_regression_and_closed_form.ipynb
  Demonstrates univariate polynomial regression (second order) using both a manual
  gradient descent loop and the closed-form normal equation solution.

- linear_regression_and_closed_form.ipynb
  Shows a simple linear regression case (one feature) with manual gradient descent
  and the closed-form solution.

- mixed_polynomial_regression_and_closed_form.ipynb
  Extends polynomial regression to mixed terms (e.g., x1^2, x2^2, x1*x2) and
  includes both gradient descent and closed-form derivations.

- SGD_linear_regression.ipynb
  Implements linear regression using scikit-learn's SGDRegressor to approximate
  the gradient descent process.

- SGD_polynomial.ipynb
  Similar to the polynomial notebook, but solved with SGDRegressor.

- SGD_mixed_polynomial.ipynb
  Applies SGDRegressor to the mixed polynomial case.

- sklearn_closed_form_linear.ipynb
  Shows the use of scikit-learn's LinearRegression class to compute the closed-form
  linear regression solution directly.

- pandas_and_phi_matrix.ipynb
  Demonstrates how to use pandas to read CSV data and construct the feature matrix
  (phi), including adding a bias column for regression.

- data.csv
  Small dataset used for polynomial regression examples.

- x.csv
  Small dataset with one column (x values) used for linear regression examples.

Note: The "__MACOSX" files are system metadata from macOS and can be ignored.
